Exercise-4 (page 131): Problem 8
(actually on page 132)
	Create an array of five sayings:
	"an apple a day keeps the docor away"
	"procrastination is a thief in time"
	"the early bird catches the worm"
	"handsome is is handsome does"
	"too many cooks spoil the broth"

	each time your, a random saying will be printed. hint: the index of the 
	array will be the random number generated

Exercise-5 (page 161): Problem 1
	physicists tell us that the lowest possible temperature is absolute zero.  
	absolute zero is -459.69 (note: actually the most current number I can find 
	is -459.67 which suggests the book was never right) degress Fahrenheit.
	a.) Accept input from the user: a beginning temperature, an ending
		temperature, and an increment (all fahrenheit).
	b.) check for bad input: at temp less than absolute zere and an ending
		temperature less than a beginning temperature. the program will send a 
		message to stderr if either condition is detected. the program will 
		send a message to stderr if either condition is detected.
	c.) print a header showing "fahrenheit celsius " print all the values from
		the beginning temperature to the ending temperature. use a looping 
		mechanism. the conversion formula is C = (F - 32) / 1.8

	* bonus: make sure the user enters a number, either decimal or floating 
	* point; e.g., 5.5, .5, or 5. (note: this is stupid it should just convert 
	* it instead of making the users life harder)
