	<h2>Class Policies</h2>
	<h3>Grading</h3>
	<p>
		<i><b>Homework: </b></i>
		Homework is worth 5 to 10 points and will be given
		daily. A quiz consisting of 1 or 2 homework problems from the
		previous week may be given in place of homework.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Tests and Quizzes: </b></i>
		Quizzes are worth 10 to 25 points and will be
		given at least once a month. Tests are worth up to 100 points and
		will be given three times each  quarter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i><b>Labs: </b></i>
		Labs are worth 10 to 30 points and will be graded on
		safety, participation, and write-up. Reports should be neatly
		written or typed. Research projects will also be assigned throughout
		the year.
	</p>
	<h3>Appointments</h3>
	<p>
		You can meet with Mr. Dub&#233; before or after school or during most
		lunch hours in room H113. Do not hesitate to ask for help! It can be
		very hard to catch up if you fall behind.
	</p>
	<h3>Safety</h3>
	<p>
		Labs are completed weekly. Because of the potential danger of any
		lab exercise, you will follow the highest standards of conduct.
		Misbehavior can result in dismissal from the lab.
