<p>M13 is one of the most prominent and best known globular clusters 
of the Northern sky. It was discovered in 1714 by the noted English
astronomer, Edmond Halley. Located in the Hercules constellation, M13 is 
visible to the naked eye on clear nights in dark sky locations.</p>
<p>The cluster contains perhaps as many as 500,000 stars, though some 
estimates push that number even up to a million. M13 is estimated to be 
about 14 billion years old, which places the date of its origin near to 
the date of the galaxy's birth.</p>
