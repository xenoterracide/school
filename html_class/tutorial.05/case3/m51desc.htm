<p>M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy, was one of Charles Messier's original
discoveries. First catalogued in 1773, M51 is the dominant member
of a small group of galaxies located over 37 million lightyears
away. M51 is easy to see under dark sky conditions, but it is quite
sensitive to light pollution.</p>
<p>The smaller galaxy, NGC5195, is sometimes referred to as "M51B", while
the larger galaxy is identified as "M51A". According to current theories, 
the spiral structure of M51A is a result of its encounter with the smaller
galaxy. The interaction of the two objects, compressed and disturbed the
gas in several regions, resulting the formation of new young stars.</p>
