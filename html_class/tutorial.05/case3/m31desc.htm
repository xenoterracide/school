<p>The Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is our nearest large galaxy. At
a distance of 2.9 million lightyears, the galaxy is one of the
chief items in the "Local Group" of galaxys, of which our own is
part.</p>
<p>Andromeda can be easily glimpsed by the naked eye under even 
moderate viewing conditions. The Persian astronomer, Al-Sufi, referred
to M31 as "the little cloud." The first telescopic description of
M31 is credited to Simon Marius in 1612. Andromeda is easily the most 
studied galaxy because it allows us to observe features of our own Milky 
Way galaxy from the outside.</p>
