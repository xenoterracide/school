<p>M16, better known as the Eagle Nebula, is located in the 
distant constellation, Serpens. The source of light for M16
is the high-energy radiation of the massive young stars being
formed in its core. By studying M16, astronomers hope to learn
more about the early years of our own Sun.</p>
<p>Philippe Loys de Ch&#233;seaux discovered the nebula in 1745. Charles
Messier was the first to notice that the stars in M16 appear to emit
a faint glow, providing the first clues that the nebula was a
stellar nursery.</p>
