Welcome to one of America's best climbing schools located in one of America's
best climbing areas, Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<p>Nowhere else in America is there such a rich variety of technically challenging
rock, ice and high alpine routes. The area presents the climber a choice of 
either one and two pitch climbs, or big wall and fourteen thousand foot 
mountaineering. Whether you are here to enjoy the spectacular scenery or to 
train for an expedition, you can choose no better place than Rocky Mountain 
National Park.</p>
<p>And no one else brings the experience of the Rockies to 
you better than the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: brown">Yale Climbing School

an experienced mountaineer looking for guides to take you on some of RMNP's 
more challenging climbs, consider us your gateway to the mountains.</p>
<p>We provide five levels of instruction, ranging from Beginner to Advanced,
including lessons in aid and ice climbing. Members of our experienced staff
have led expeditions in Mexico, Nepal and Pakistan. All have intimate
knowledge of Rocky Mountain National Park and know the best places to go
to help you experience the wonder and beauty of the park.</p>
