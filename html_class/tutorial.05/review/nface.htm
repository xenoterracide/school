<p>The North Face route of Longs Peak is the perfect tour for the beginner 
hiker/climber who wants to reach the summit following a different route from 
the main trail. The North Face is the most direct and shortest route and does 
not have the crowds you'd find in the more popular Keyhole route. The views 
from the North Face are spectacular and provide some of the finest scenery in 
the park.</p>
