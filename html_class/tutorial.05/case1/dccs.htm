Doc-Centric Sales: South Region
</h3>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0">
Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight
downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under
sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25
unit which increased as last year progressed.
