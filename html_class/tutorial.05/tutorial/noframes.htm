     <p>Nowhere else in America is there such a rich variety of technically 
     challenging rock, ice and high alpine routes. The area presents the

     fourteen thousand foot mountaineering. Whether you are here to enjoy the
     spectacular scenery or to train for an expedition, you can choose no 
     better place than Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
