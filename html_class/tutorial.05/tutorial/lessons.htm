Here at the Yale Climbing School we provide several levels of climbing instruction, 
all tailored to your individual strengths, interests and comfort levels. You can start 
your lessons on small one and two pitch climbs and move up to larger
routes. We cover everything from working with hand and footholds to working
with ice axes. Lessons are always under the watchful and encouraging eye
of an experienced instructor. Special instruction is also available for 
those with special physical needs or requirements.</p>
<p>NOTE: Students may be removed from the courses for safety reasons at any 
time based on the discretion of the instructor. Partial refunds available
for any uncompleted courses.</p>
