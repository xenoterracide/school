	<h1>Martin Luther King, Jr.</h1>

		<span class="drop_letter">I </span>
		have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out 
		the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be 
		self-evident: that all men are created equal." I have a dream 
		that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former 
		slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit 
		down together at a table of brotherhood. I have a dream that 
		one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, 
		sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be 
		transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a 
		dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where 
		they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the 
		content of their character. I have a dream today.

		I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose 
		governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of 
		interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a 
		situation where little black boys and black girls will be able 
		to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk 
		together as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have 
		a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill 
		and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made 
		plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the 
		glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it 
		together.  This is our hope. This is the faith with which I 
		return to the South.  With this faith we will be able to hew 
		out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith 
		we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our 
		nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this 
		faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to 
		struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for 
		freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
	</p>
	<p>
		This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to 
		sing with a new meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land 
		of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of 
		the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom 
		ring." And if America is to be a great nation, this must become 
		true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New 
		Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New 
		York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of 
		Pennsylvania! Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of 
		Colorado! Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of 
		California! But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone 
		Mountain of Georgia! Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of 
		Tennessee! Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill 
		of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every 
		village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we 
		will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, 
		black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and 
		Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of 
		the old Negro spiritual,
		<!-- em or strong is more appropriate structurally than span.  
		That's why they exist -->
		<em> Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are 
		free at last!</em>
