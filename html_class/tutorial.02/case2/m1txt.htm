<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There is no precedent for the gigantically conceived first movement of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In an early description of this movement, 
Beethoven used the word "despair", though the finished work evokes a blend
of despair, chaos, and ultimately - defiance. The hushed opening creates an
image of music emerging from the void; indeed the opening theme has been called
"the Void Music".</p>
<p>In the second section of the first movement, Beethoven develops the
Defiance theme, reworking the theme in different pitches and applying a
powerful fugue. Tying this development together is a systematic exploration
of the Defiance theme as Beethoven fragments the theme, first the head, then 
the middle, and finally the tail. In the recapitulation, Beethoven restores 
the original themes of the Exposition section in their orignal order, but 
with struggles within these themes being played just below the surface.</p>
<p>The first movement's coda is unusual for it's extended length and for
the fact that it does not attempt to resolve the disintegration of the themes
carried over from the recapitulation. In fact, the coda evokes a mood of 
bleakness which parallels the Defiance theme.</p>
