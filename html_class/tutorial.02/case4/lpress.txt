Body Systems LP155 Leg Press/Squat Machine

Overview
The LP155 works your hips and legs, but the smoothness and quality of 
this machine spares your bones and joints. Our patented quad track roller 
system functions with minimal friction and distributes weight more evenly 
than traditional designs. An anti-skid diamond plate press deck saves space 
and creates a feeling of dynamic control. Adjustable for all heights and sizes. 
For Olympic Plates Only.
