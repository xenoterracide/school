<blockquote><p><i><b>Homework</b></i>: Homework will be given daily and is due 
at the beginning of the next class. Homework is worth 5 to 10 points. 
A quiz consisting of 1 or 2 homework problems from the previous week may 
be given in place of homework.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i><b>Tests and quizzes</b></i>: Quizzes are worth 10 to 25 
points. Tests are worth up to 100 points. Quizzes will be given
at least once month. Tests will be given 2 or 3 times a quarter.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i><b>Labs</b></i>: Labs are worth 10 to 30 points. Labs will be
graded on safety, participation, and write-up. Reports must be neatly 
written or typed.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i><b>Research projects</b></i>: To explore other aspects of 
chemistry, small research projects will be assigned throughout the
year.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>You must make up missed tests and quizzes the day you return, and 
you must submit missed homework assignments and labs within two days 
for every one day you missed. Failure to make up work on time will result 
in a 0 for that test or assignment.</p></blockquote>
