            <p>
             I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat at Dunston. 
             I came to your center haggard and worn out from a long illness and 
             job difficulties. I left totally refreshed.</p>

             <p>I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful
             place you have. Some of us are hoping to organize a group retreat.
             Rest assured that you'll see me again. Going to Dunston will become
             a yearly event for me.</p>
