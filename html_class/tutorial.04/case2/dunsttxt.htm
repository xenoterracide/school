					Welcome. Whether you are planning to 
					attend one of our many conferences or 
					embarking on a private retreat, we're 
					sure that you will enjoy your stay.
				</p>
				<p>
					Located in the northern woods of 
					Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat Center 
					provides comfortable and attractive 
					accommodations while you enjoy the 
					rustic setting available just outside 
					your door. The Retreat Center has 32 
					beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, 
					and kitchen facilities.  If you want to 
					get out, there are ample opportunities 
					for hiking, canoeing and horseback 
					riding in the surrounding area.

						I'm writing to tell you how 
						much I enjoyed my retreat at 
						Dunston.  I came to your center 
						haggard and worn out from a 
						long illness and job 
						difficulties. I left totally 
						refreshed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've enthusiastically told all 
						of my friends about the 
						wonderful place you have.  Some 
						of us are hoping to organize a 
						group retreat.  Rest assured 
						that you'll see me again. Going 
						to Dunston will become a yearly 
						event for me.

					Throughout the year the center staff 
					conducts retreats to accommodate the 
					needs of various groups. We offer 
					retreats for men, for women, and for 
					couples. Please call about special 
					needs retreats.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you prefer, an individually directed 
					retreat is possible.  The retreat 
					includes a time of daily sharing and 
					guidance by a retreat director to 
					supplement your private time of 
					solitude and meditation.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the Dunston Retreat Center we make 
					everything as easy as possible, 
					providing meals, towels, bedding - 
					everything you need.  Just bring 
					yourself.
