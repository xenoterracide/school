      If You Encounter a Cougar
   </h3>
   <p style="color: white; font-size: 0.8em">
   Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.<br /><br />
   Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.<br /><br />
   Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.<br /><br />
   If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince 
   the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.<br /><br />
   In the case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.
