      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(182,29,23)">dHome Inc.</span> is the 
      leading manufacturer of dome structures in the world. Our domes are built to exacting
      standards using the highest quality materials. We've been building domes for over
      35 years and have a proven track record of providing quality homes at reasonable
      prices.</p>
   
      <p>A dome house provides you with a totally new living experience in a spacious
      and open environment. Imagine a curved ceiling more than 20 feet high with
      skylights bringing the beauty of the outdoors into your home.</p>

      <p>We provide plans for eight different domes, ranging from a 36'
      model providing 1000 square feet of living space, to a 48' diameter model 
      covering over 1800 square feet and containing a loft capable of supporting 
      a master bedroom. Each plan includes options for customized triangular 
      windows using annodized aluminum frames with thermal break rubber seals, 
      and argon filled insulated glass. Custom plans are also available upon 
      request.</p>
