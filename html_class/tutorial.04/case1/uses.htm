            <p style="font-size: 12; font-family: sans-serif; color: white">Why build a 
            dome house? Domes are stronger and safer than conventional
            homes, and their design provides more stability against hurricanes,
            tornados, and earthquakes.<br /><br />
      
            Dome houses are also more energy efficient. A dome home has approximately
            30 to 50% less roof and wall area exposed to the elements than conventional
            homes, resulting in reduced energy costs.<br /><br />

            The spherical space also provides for a natural air flow, minimizing 
            cold spots and increasing interior comfort.</p>
