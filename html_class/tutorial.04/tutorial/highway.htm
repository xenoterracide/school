   <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif">Highway 6 Reopens</h3>

   <p>Highway 6 will reopen this Friday, May 3<sup>rd</sup>, after a final safety 
   inspection. A late blizzard delayed road crews, marking this as one of the 
   latest dates for the highway's reopening on record.</p> 
        
   <p>Rising to an elevation of 12,351 feet at Grace Pass, Highway 6 is a main link 
   between Park City and Lake Elton. The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs 
   that summer is near and the tourist season will soon be upon us!</p>
