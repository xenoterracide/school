Assignment A:
Use the Java program Code3 presented in the Course Documents section. Compile 
and Run the program.

In Code3 there are (6) numbered items. The first four are compiler errors.  
Include a separate Word document with your assignment and explain why each will 
produce a compiler error and what you would do to fix the problem.  Explain 
what is happening in 5 and 6 and why this code will prevent a possible compiler 
error.
