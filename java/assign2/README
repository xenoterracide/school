Assignment A (20 pts.); pg. 173, PE. #1a f (10 pts.) and #5 (10 pts.)

Assignment A:
Use the Java program Code3 presented in the Course Documents section. Compile 
and Run the program.

In Code3 there are (6) numbered items. The first four are compiler errors.  
Include a separate Word document with your assignment and explain why each will 
produce a compiler error and what you would do to fix the problem.  Explain 
what is happening in 5 and 6 and why this code will prevent a possible compiler 
error.

PE #1
a: Write Java statements that import the classes Scanner, FileReader, and 
PrintWriter from the packages java.util and java.io

b: Write statements that declare inFile to be a reference variable of type
Scanner and outFile to be a reference of variable of type PrintWriter

c: the program will read data fromt he file inData.txt and write output to the 
file outData.dat. Write statements to open both these files, associate inFile 
with inData.txt, and associate outFile with outData.dat

d: suppose that the file inData.txt contains the following data:

56 38
A
7 8

write statements so that after the program executes, the contents of the 
outData.dat are as shown below. if necessary, declare additional variables.  
your statements should be general enough so that if the content of the input 
file changes and the program is run again (without editing and recompiling), it 
outputs the appropriate results:

The sum of 56 and 38 = 94.
The character that comes after A in the Unicode set is B.
The product of a 7 and 8 = 56.
