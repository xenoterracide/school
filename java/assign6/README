Loop (Method) Assignment (40 pts.).

Loop(Method) Assignment: 

Access the Loop-Assign document from Week #5. You have already written the code 
for the four loop problems which you will now combine into one program with 
four distinct methods. For this assignment you will write methods, two value 
returning methods and two void methods. You may choose which of the four 
problems are coded into which method. Each method must represent one of the 4 
distinct loop problems. The methods must include:

one value-returning method with a parameter

one value-returning method without a parameter

one void method with a parameter

one void method without a parameter

Your program must compile and run.
