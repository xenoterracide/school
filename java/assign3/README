Assignment B:
Write a program that instructs the user to enter a number between 1-4 OR the 
letters a-e (the user might enter a "b" or "3" - they will enter a letter or 
number based on one prompt). [This means that the User has a choice, therefore, 
you must write code for BOTH situations.] Read the number or letter from the 
screen and use an IF statement to make sure that the number or letter is in the 
proper range. Your output to the user will be:

 "Congratulations you entered" (their number/letter) OR "Sorry you entered an 
 invalid character" (their number/letter).
