  <p>Siberian tigers are the world's largest cats. They live primarily in eastern Russia's birch forests,
  though some exist in China and North Korea. There are an estimated 400 to 500 Siberian tigers living in the wild,
  and recent studies suggest that these numbers are stable. Though their northern climate is far harsher than those
  of other tigers, these animals have some advantages. Northern forests offer the lowest human density of any tiger
  habitat, and the most complete ecosystem. The vast woodlands also allow tigers far more room to roam, as Russia's
  timber industry is currently less extensive than that of many other countries.
  </p>
 
  <p>Tigers live alone and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals away. They are powerful
  hunters that travel many miles to find prey, such as elk and wild boar, on nocturnal hunts. Tigers use their
  distinctive coats as camouflage and hunt by stealth. They lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their
  victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce. A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60 pounds in one night, though
  they usually eat less.
  </p>
 
  <p>Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from the male. Cubs
  cannot hunt until they are 18 months old, and remain with their mothers for two to three years, when they disperse
  to find their own territory.
