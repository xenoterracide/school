  <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. Prides are family units that may include
  up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs
  typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking
  over a group headed by another male.
  </p>
 
  <p>Only male lions boast manes, the impressive fringe of long hair that encircles their heads. Males defend the
  pride's territory, which may include some 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) of grasslands, scrub, or open
  woodlands. Female lions are the pride's primary hunters. They often work together to prey upon antelopes, zebras,
  wildebeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands. Many of these animals are faster than lions, so
  teamwork pays off.
  </p>
 
  <p>After the hunt, the group effort often degenerates to squabbling over the sharing of the kill, with cubs at
  the bottom of the pecking order. Young lions do not help to hunt until they are about a year old. Lions will hunt
  alone if the opportunity presents itself, and they also steal kills from hyenas or wild dogs.
