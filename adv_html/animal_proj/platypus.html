	The Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a semi-aquatic mammal endemic to 
	eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Together with the four species of 
	echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only 
	mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. It is the sole 
	living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus 
	(Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related species have been found in 
	the fossil record.
</p>
<p>
	The bizarre appearance of this egg-laying, venomous, duck-billed, 
	beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they 
	first encountered it, with some considering it an elaborate fraud. It is 
	one of the few venomous mammals; the male Platypus has a spur on the hind 
	foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans. The 
	unique features of the Platypus make it an important subject in the study 
	of evolutionary biology and a recognizable and iconic symbol of Australia; 
	it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is featured on the 
	reverse of the Australian 20 cent coin.
</p>
<p>
	Until the early 20th century it was hunted for its fur, but it is now 
	protected throughout its range. Although captive breeding programs have had 
	only limited success and the Platypus is vulnerable to the effects of 
	pollution, it is not under any immediate threat.
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
	The body and the broad, flat tail of the Platypus are covered with dense 
	brown fur that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal 
	warm. The Platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves (an 
	adaptation also found in animals such as the Tasmanian Devil and 
	fat-tailed sheep). It has webbed feet and a large, rubbery snout; these are 
	features that appear closer to those of a duck than to those of any known 
	mammal. The webbing is more significant on the front feet and is folded 
	back when walking on land. Unlike a bird's beak (in which both the upper 
	and lower parts of the beak separate to reveal its mouth), the snout of the 
	Platypus is a sensory organ with the mouth on the underside. The nostrils 
	are located on the dorsal surface of the snout while the eyes and ears are 
	located in a groove set just back from it; this groove is closed when 
	swimming. Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed 
	and a range of other vocalisations have been reported in captive 
	specimens.
</p>
<p>
	Weight varies considerably from 700 g (1.54 lb) to 2.4 kg (5.3 lb) with 
	males being larger than females: males average 50 cm (20 in) total length 
	while females average 43 cm (17 in). There is substantial variation in 
	average size from one region to another, and this pattern does not seem to 
	follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other environmental 
	factors such as predation and human encroachment.
</p>
<p>
	The Platypus has an average body temperature of 31?32 째C (88?90 째F) rather 
	than the 37 째C (100 째F) typical of placental mammals. Research suggests 
	this has been a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions on the 
	part of the small number of surviving monotreme species rather than a 
	historical characteristic of monotremes.
</p>
<p>
	Modern Platypus young have three-cusped molars which they lose before or 
	just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults have heavily 
	keratinised pads in their place. The Platypus jaw is constructed 
	differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is 
	different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in 
	the middle ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in 
	the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids. However, the 
	external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The 
	Platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an 
	interclavicle, which is not found in other mammals. It has a reptilian 
	gait, with legs that are on the sides of the body, rather than 
	underneath.
</p>
<p>
	The male Platypus has ankle spurs which produce a cocktail of venom, 
	composed largely of defensin-like proteins (DLPs), which is unique to the 
	Platypus. Although powerful enough to kill smaller animals, the 
	venom is not lethal to humans, but is so excruciating that the victim may 
	be incapacitated. Oedema rapidly develops around the wound and gradually 
	spreads throughout the affected limb. Information obtained from case 
	histories and anecdotal evidence indicates that the pain develops into a 
	long-lasting hyperalgesia that persists for days or even months. 
	Venom is produced in the crural glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped 
	alveolar glands connected by a thin-walled duct to a calcaneus spur on each 
	hind limb. The female Platypus, in common with echidnas, has rudimentary 
	spur buds which do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first 
	year) and lack functional crural glands.
</p>
<p>
	The venom appears to have a different function from those produced by 
	non-mammalian species: its effects are non-life threatening but 
	nevertheless powerful enough to seriously impair the victim. Since only 
	males produce venom and production rises during the breeding season it is 
	theorized that it is used as an offensive weapon to assert dominance during 
	this period.
</p>
<p>
	Monotremes are the only mammals known to have a sense of electroreception: 
	they locate their prey in part by detecting electric fields generated by 
	muscular contractions. The Platypus' electroreception is the most sensitive 
	of any monotreme.
</p>
<p>
	The electroreceptors are located in rostro-caudal rows in the skin of the 
	bill, while mechanoreceptors (which detect touch) are uniformly distributed 
	across the bill. The electrosensory area of the cerebral cortex is 
	contained within the tactile somatosensory area, and some cortical cells 
	receive input from both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting a 
	close association between the tactile and electric senses. Both 
	electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the bill dominate the somatotopic 
	map of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the 
	Panfield homunculus map.
</p>
<p>
	The Platypus can determine the direction of an electric source, perhaps by 
	comparing differences in signal strength across the sheet of 
	electroreceptors.  This would explain the animal's characteristic 
	side-to-side motion of its head while hunting. The cortical convergence of 
	electrosensory and tactile inputs suggests a mechanism for determining the 
	distance of prey items which, when they move, emit both electrical signals 
	and mechanical pressure pulses, which would also allow for computation of 
	distance from the difference in time of arrival of the two signals.
</p>
<p>
	The Platypus feeds by digging in the bottom of streams with its bill. The 
	electroreceptors could be used to distinguish animate and inanimate objects 
	in this situation (in which the mechanoreceptors would be continuously 
	stimulated). When disturbed, its prey would generate tiny electrical 
	currents in their muscular contractions which the sensitive 
	electroreceptors of the Platypus could detect. Experiments have shown that 
	the Platypus will even react to an 'artificial shrimp' if a small 
	electrical current is passed through it.
</p>
<p>
	The Platypus is semi-aquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an 
	extensive range from the cold highlands of Tasmania and the Australian Alps 
	to the tropical rainforests of coastal Queensland as far north as the base 
	of the Cape York Peninsula. Inland, its distribution is not well known: 
	it is extinct in South Australia (barring an introduced population on 
	Kangaroo Island) and is no longer found in the main part of the 
	Murray-Darling Basin, possibly due to the declining water quality brought 
	about by extensive land clearing and irrigation schemes. Along the 
	coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable; it appears to be 
	absent from some relatively healthy rivers, and yet maintains a presence in 
	others that are quite degraded (the lower Maribyrnong, for example).
</p>
<p>
	In captivity Platypuses have survived to seventeen years of age and wild 
	specimens have been recaptured at eleven years old. Mortality rates for 
	adults in the wild appear to be low. Natural predators include snakes, 
	water rats, goannas, hawks, owls and eagles. Low Platypus numbers in 
	northern Australia are possibly due to predation by crocodiles. The 
	introduction of red foxes as a predator for rabbits may have had some 
	impact on its numbers on the mainland. The Platypus is generally 
	regarded as nocturnal and crepuscular, but individuals are also active 
	during the day, particularly when the sky is overcast. Its habitat 
	bridges rivers and the riparian zone for both a food supply of prey species 
	and banks where it can dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a 
	range of up to 7 km (4.4 mi) with male's home ranges overlapping with those 
	of 3 or 4 females.
</p>
<p>
	The Platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the 
	water foraging for food. When swimming it can be distinguished from other 
	Australian mammals by the absence of visible ears. Uniquely among 
	mammals it propels itself when swimming by alternate rowing motion with the 
	front two feet; although all four feet of the Platypus are webbed, the hind 
	feet (which are held against the body) do not assist in propulsion, but are 
	used for steering in combination with the tail. The species is 
	endothermic, maintaining its body temperature about 32 째C, lower than most 
	mammals, even while foraging for hours in water below 5 째C (41 째F).
</p>
<p>
	Dives normally last around 30 seconds, but can last longer although few 
	exceed the estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds. 10 to 20 seconds are 
	commonly spent in recovery at the surface. The Platypus is a 
	carnivore: it feeds on annelid worms and insect larvae, freshwater shrimps, 
	and yabbies (freshwater crayfish) that it digs out of the riverbed with its 
	snout or catches while swimming. It utilizes cheek-pouches to carry prey to 
	the surface where they are eaten. The Platypus needs to eat about 20% 
	of its own weight each day.  This requires the Platypus to spend an average 
	of 12 hours each day looking for food. When not in the water, the 
	Platypus retires to a short, straight resting burrow of oval cross-section, 
	nearly always in the riverbank not far above water level, and often hidden 
	under a protective tangle of roots.
