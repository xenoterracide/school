<p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a bear native to the Arctic. The world's largest land carnivore, an adult male weighs around 300–600 kg (660–1320 lb), while an adult female is about half that size. Although it is closely related to the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrow ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice, and open water, and for hunting seals. It feeds almost exclusively on seals, although it is an opportunistic feeder and will eat almost anything if hungry. It is the apex predator within its range.</p>

<p>The polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species. Of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations, 5 are declining, 5 are stable, 2 are increasing, and 7 have insufficient data.For decades, unrestricted hunting raised international concern for the future of the species; populations have rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect.</p>

<p>The IUCN now lists global warming as the most significant threat to the polar bear, primarily because the melting of its sea ice habitat reduces its ability to find sufficient food. The IUCN states, "If climatic trends continue polar bears may become extirpated from most of their range within 100 years." The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formally proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species on January 7, 2007. A final decision was due on January 7, 2008 but has been delayed.</p>

<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>The polar bear is often regarded as a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea.Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice (that is, ice that melts for part of the year) covering the waters over the continental shelf and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos. These areas have relatively high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic. The polar bear tends to frequent areas of open water, such as polynyas and leads to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet. Polar bears are therefore found primarily along the perimeter of the polar ice pack, rather than in the Polar Basin close to the North Pole where the density of seals is low.</p>

<p>Annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes. Seals migrate in response to these changes, and polar bears must follow their prey. In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as "ice-floe breakup"), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up. In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat to the multi-year ice (that is, ice that remains solid year-round) further north each summer.</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>Unlike grizzly bears, polar bears are not territorial. Although stereotyped as being voraciously aggressive, they are normally cautious in confrontations, and often choose to escape rather than fight. However, polar bears have been known to kill and sometimes eat humans. Wild polar bears are poorly habituated to humans and will quickly assess any animal they encounter as potential prey.</p>

<p>Although adult polar bears live solitary lives in general, they have often been seen playing together for hours at a time, and polar bear zoologist Nikita Ovsianikov has described adult males as having "well-developed friendships." Cubs are especially playful as well. Among young males in particular, play-fighting may be a means of practicing for serious competition during mating seasons later in life.</p>

<p>In 1992, a photographer near Churchill, Manitoba took a now widely-circulated set of photographs of a polar bear playing with a Canadian Eskimo dog a tenth of its size.The pair wrestled harmlessly together each afternoon for ten days in a row for no apparent reason, although the bear may have been trying to demonstrate its friendliness in the hope of sharing the kennel's food. This kind of social interaction is uncommon; it is far more typical for polar bears to behave aggressively towards dogs.</p>
