	Reptiles are air-breathing, cold-blooded vertebrates that have skin covered 
	in scales as opposed to hair or feathers. They are tetrapods (having or 
	having descended from vertebrates with four limbs) and amniotes, whose 
	embryos are surrounded by an amniotic membrane. Modern reptiles inhabit 
	every continent with the exception of Antarctica, and are represented by 
	four living orders:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Crocodilia (crocodiles, gharials, caimans and alligators): 23 species
	</li>
	<li>
		Sphenodontia (tuatara from New Zealand): 2 species
	</li>
	<li>
		Squamata (lizards, snakes and amphisbaenids ("worm-lizards")): 
		approximately 7,900 species
	</li>
	<li>
		Testudines (turtles and tortoises): approximately 300 species
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The majority of reptile species are oviparous (egg-laying) although certain 
	species of squamates are capable of giving live birth. This is achieved, 
	either through ovoviviparity (egg retention), or viviparity (offspring born 
	without use of calcified eggs). Many of the viviparous species feed their 
	fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals 
	with some providing initial care for their hatchlings.  Extant reptiles 
	range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero, at 1.6 cm (0.6 
	in), to the Saltwater Crocodile, at up to at least 7 m (23 feet).
