<p>Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars. They live in 
sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are 
endangered, especially outside of Africa.</p>

<p>The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches. Leopards can 
also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow them to blend with the leaves until they spring with a deadly 
pounce. These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy movements in the tall grass. 
When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs and, occasionally, people. Leopards are strong 
swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs.</p>

<p>Female leopards can give birth at any time of the year. They usually have two grayish cubs with barely visible 
spots. The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they are old enough to 
begin playing and learning to hunt. Cubs live with their mothers for about two years—otherwise, leopards are 
solitary animals.</p>

<p>Most leopards are light colored with distinctive dark spots that are called rosettes, because they resemble 
the shape of a rose. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots are hard to 
distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.</p>
