System's Architecture
Assignment EC1

1. Given that the tools are proprietary the company shouldn't invest money 
further in the system. Instead it should focus on finding a data migration tool 
or paying someone to migrate the data (which shouldn't be too overwhelming a 
task given the files are flat files). I would suggest going with a web 
framework or cms that is capable of doing what they need to do, preferrably and 
open source one so they aren't locked into a proprietary system in the future.  
I would expect that. If they used a framework like Perl's Catalyst they could 
possibly interface directly to these flat files.

2. Over a period of time they should try to replace the technology, however 
doing it all at once is unlikely to be productive or profitable. They should 
also only reimplement what they need, if they can find a technology to replace 
it in place and port the data to it, it might be even cheaper.

3. depending on how they acquire new tools they could run the risk of using 
another software who's company could go bankrupt. They could incur an excessive 
amount of expense developing a new system which turns out not to be as good as 
the last or buggy.
