Assignment #7

IBM uses chipkill which spreads out bit lines from a single memory chip over 
multiple ECC checkers. To avoid uncorrectable errors in memory, IBM uses a 
dynamic spare memory scheme called “redundant bit-steering.” this includes 
spare memobery bits within each ECC word so if a bit goes bad it can be steered 
to a new bit for use.
