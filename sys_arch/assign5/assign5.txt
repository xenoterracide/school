9.) Simplex is where a single wire can only transmit data 1 direction, 
half-duplex allows it to transmit it bi-directionally, full-duplex essentially 
uses 2 lines in simplex mode, transmitting in opposite directons. Given todays 
costs there is little in the way of cost advantages over full-duplex lines, 
given most lines must carry data both ways, and half-duplex can be extremely 
error prone.

12.) synchrynous transmissions are constantly synching clocks and sending data 
frames of the sames size, at consistent intervals. Asyschrynous transmissions 
are as/needed and clocks must be resysnced at transmission to compensate for 
clock drift.

14.) odd parity counts the number of 1's in the byte and sets the parity bit to 
1 if the number is even, even parity is the opposite setting it 0 if the count 
is even.
