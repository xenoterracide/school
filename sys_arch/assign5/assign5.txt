9. Describe Simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex transmission. compare and 
contrast them in terms of cost and effective data transfer rate.

Simplex is where a single wire can only transmit data 1 direction, half-duplex 
allows it to transmit it bi-directionally, full-duplex essentially uses 2 lines 
in simplex mode, transmitting in opposite directons. Given todays costs there 
is little in the way of cost advantages over full-duplex lines, given most 
lines must carry data both ways, and half-duplex can be extremely error prone.

12. What are the differences between synchrynous and asynchrynous data 
transmission?

synchrynous transmissions are constantly synching clocks and sending data 
frames of the sames size, at consistent intervals. Asyschrynous transmissions 
are as/needed and clocks must be resysnced at transmission to compensate for 
clock drift.
