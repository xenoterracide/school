9.) Simplex is where a single wire can only transmit data 1 direction, 
half-duplex allows it to transmit it bi-directionally, full-duplex essentially 
uses 2 lines in simplex mode, transmitting in opposite directons. Given todays 
costs there is little in the way of cost advantages over full-duplex lines, 
given most lines must carry data both ways, and half-duplex can be extremely 
error prone.


10.) synchrynous transmissions are constantly synching clocks and sending data 
frames of the sames size, at consistent intervals. Asyschrynous transmissions 
are as/needed and clocks must be resysnced at transmission to compensate for 
clock drift.
