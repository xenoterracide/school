Error Correction is achieved using forward error correction (FEC). 2 codes, 
convolution code (CC) and low density parity check code (LDPC) are consiered 
for this purpose.

802.16 will likely not replace 802.11 as it was designed for carriers and not 
consumers. it isn't cheap and hasn't been widely deployed yet.
