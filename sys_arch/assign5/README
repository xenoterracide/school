Homework 5 	Pick 2 of Ch8 research problems (pg 353)

1. Parity checking is often used in computer memory to detect errors.  
Investigate the current available memory types, including parity and error 
correcting circuits (ECC) memory. How is parity checking implemented within the 
memory module? How are errors detected, and what happens when an error is 
detected? what types of computer systems should use parity or ECC memeory and 
why?

2. Research infiniband archticecture to investigate some issues not addresed in 
the chapter. what is signal encoding, cables, and connectors are used? is the 
channel serial or parallel? is transmission synchronous or asynchronous? how 
are erros detected and corrected?

3. Investigate the IEEE Firewre datacommunication standard. how is data 
encoded, and what is the raw transmission speed? describe how the standard 
enables quality-of-service guarantees when transmitting multimedia or other 
time-sensitive data.

4. Investigate teh IEEE 806.16 (WiMax) wireless networking standard. how do 
transmission speeds and the distance compare to IEEE 802.11 standards? what 
method(s) is/are used to detect and correct transmission errors? will 802.16 
networks eventually replace 802.11 networks?
