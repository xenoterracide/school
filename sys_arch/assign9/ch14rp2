Assignment #9

in short all firewall products are suitable for #1 and #2 questions. In fact 
depending on the traffic quantity requirements, all firewalls could fullfill 
these requirements. given that the 3rd question suggests a large bandwidth 
requirement I'm suggesting these firewalls, ASA5505 for 1 5510 for 2 and 5520 
for 3.
