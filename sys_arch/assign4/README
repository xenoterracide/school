ch6 p254 Review Question 9, 12, 13

9. What is a buffer? Why might one be used?

12. Describe how scaling up differs from scaling out. Given the speed 
difference between a typical system bus and a typical high speed network, is it 
reasonable to assume that both approaches can yield similar increases in total 
computational power.

13. What is a multicore processor? what are it's advantages compared to 
multi-cpu architecture? why have multicore processors only recently become 
available?
