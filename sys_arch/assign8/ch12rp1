z/OS the most recent descendant of MVS supports several kinds of data sets that 
it uses for a file system. these data sets are not all that different from and 
RDBMS.

	In a sequential data set, records are data items that are stored 
consecutively.  To retrieve the tenth item in the data set, for example, the 
system must first pass the preceding nine items. Data items that must all be 
used in sequence, like the alphabetical list of names in a classroom roster, 
are best stored in a sequential data set.

	A partitioned data set or PDS consists of a directory and members. The 
directory holds the address of each member and thus makes it possible for 
programs or the operating system to access each member directly. Each member, 
however, consists of sequentially stored records. Partitioned data sets are 
often called libraries. Programs are stored as members of partitioned data 
sets. Generally, the operating system loads the members of a PDS into storage 
sequentially, but it can access members directly when selecting a program for 
execution.

	In a Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) key sequenced data set (KSDS), 
records are data items that are stored with control information (keys) so that 
the system can retrieve an item without searching all preceding items in the 
data set. VSAM KSDS data sets are ideal for data items that are used frequently 
and in an unpredictable order.
