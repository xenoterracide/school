Kerberos has a single point of failure. if the server is down no one can log in 
or if it's compromised all accounts are compromised. Kerberos requires an 
Authentication Server, Service Server, and a Ticket Granting Server. Kerberos 
provides a Moderate level of security, and only truly covers the authentication 
portion of distributed applictions and resources.
