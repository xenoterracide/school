holographic storage is a means of storing data in 3 dimensions on a disc 
format. Most optical format's currenly only use a 2 dimensional format to read 
data. after decades of research an HVD appears to be on the horizon with a 
possible 500GB storage capacity, with a few competing format's. HVD is a 
replacement for DVD, and BlueRay technologies. This technology would not have 
the speed capabilities to be used for RAM at this time.
