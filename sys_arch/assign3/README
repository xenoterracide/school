ch4 p165 Research Problems 1-3

1.) Investigate the instruction set and architectural features of a modern RISC 
processor such as the Sun UltraSparc (www.sun.com), Apple/Motorola G5 
(www.apple.com/g5processor/), or IBM POWER5 (www.chips.ibm.com). In what ways 
does it differ from the architecture of the Intel Pentium and Itanium processor 
families? Which Processor(s) employ advanced techniques such as pipelining, 
speculative execution, and multiprocessing

2.) AMD (www.amd.com) produces microprocessors that execute CPU instructions 
designed for the Intel Pentium processor family. Investigate their current 
product offerings. Do they offer true Pentium Compatibility? Is their 
performance comparable to that of Intel processors?

3.) Until recently, microprocessor transistor interconnections were 
implementted with aluminum. Some manufacturers are now implementing transistor 
interconnections with copper using a process developped by IBM (www.ibm.com).  
Investigate the advantages of chips fabricated with copper. Will coper extend 
the lifetime of semi-conductor microprocessor technology? Why or why not?
