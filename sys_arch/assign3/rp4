firstly this question is horribly dated. The correct answer today is to buy 2 
1TB external drives and make sure they are a copy of each other. this can be 
done for approximately $200 is read/writable, usable on any computer with a usb 
port (e.g. 99.9%) and relatively handling durable.  14 packs of 100 CD-R's will 
cost you approximately $280 and are not rewriteable and are a pain to keep 
organized..  and only equate to 1TB of data and no backup if disc gets 
scratched. 2 packs of 100 DVD's equate to 1TB of data at approximately $50 
however these disks will be be readable on a significantly less number of 
computers. All modern PC's laptops have dvd drives, however a large number of 
'netbooks' and older computers don't have them. dvd's are much less scratch 
resistant than even cd's so making duplicate's of each would be almost 
mandatory. makeing total cost of DVD's about $100 with no rewrite capability, 
and all the organizational problems of CD's. Both CD's and DVD's require so 
much greater management time that in the course of a few months they will 
consume more hours than the 2 external drives.

note: space estimates and costs are rounded.
