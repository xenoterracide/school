This project has 2 purposes.

1.) for a backup for my homework and and any revisions it goes through. I may 
use this someday to say... look at how I used to do things :P

2.) to help further prevent teachers from repeatedly using the same assignments 
and relying on the textbook as a crutch. If I wanted to do bookwork, and watch 
someone read slides (without adding things) I would have bought the book myself 
and read the slides in the mirror. If you are doing this please find another 
job. You are a chaparone not a teacher.
